```

### 4. ✅ Complete Vault Routes Implemented
```javascript
GET    /api/vault/providers     → 24+ providers available
GET    /api/vault/keys         → List encrypted keys
POST   /api/vault/keys         → Add new keys  
POST   /api/vault/keys/:id/validate → Test key validity
POST   /api/vault/keys/:id/test     → Live API testing
DELETE /api/vault/keys/:id     → Remove keys
GET    /api/vault/analytics    → Usage statistics
```

## 🌐 How to Test the Vault System

### **Primary Testing Method: Web Interface**

**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/settings/api-vault`

### Step-by-Step Testing:

#### 1. Access the Vault Interface
- Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
- Navigate to **Settings** → **API Vault**
- Or directly: `http://localhost:3000/settings/api-vault`

#### 2. Register/Login
- Create account if needed, or use existing credentials
- The vault requires authentication for security

#### 3. Add API Keys  
- Click **"Add New API Key"** button
- Select provider from dropdown (24 available)
- Enter key details:
  - **Key Name**: "Production OpenAI" 
  - **Provider**: OpenAI
  - **API Key**: Your actual key value
- Click **Save** → Key gets encrypted automatically

#### 4. Validate Keys
- After adding, click **"Validate"** button next to any key
- System tests key against live provider API
- Results show:
  - ✅ **Valid/Invalid status**
  - 📊 **Rate limits remaining** 
  - 🕐 **Last validation time**
  - ❌ **Error details** (if invalid)

## 📊 Frontend Connection Status

Based on your console logs, I can see:

### ✅ **Working Features:**
- **WebSocket connections**: ✅ Multiple successful connections
- **Frontend loading**: ✅ All pages accessible  
- **Authentication system**: ✅ User registration/login working
- **Chat history**: ✅ Loading successfully (status 200)
- **Main app navigation**: ✅ All routes working

### 🔧 **Expected API Responses:**
From your logs, I can see the frontend is successfully:
- Connecting to websockets: `🔗 Connected to Cartrita server`  
- Loading chat data: `📨 Chat history data received`
- Accessing vault interface: Password fields visible for API keys

## 🔐 Vault Security Features Active

### **Encryption Layer**
- All keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- Unique initialization vectors per key
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Keys displayed as masked in UI: `sk-***...***`

### **Audit System**  
- All vault operations logged
- Security events tracked:
  - Key creation/deletion
  - Validation attempts  
  - Access patterns
- OpenTelemetry metrics collected

### **Provider Validation**
Each API provider has specific validation:
- **OpenAI**: Tests completion endpoint
- **Google**: OAuth token validation
- **GitHub**: Repository access test
- **Deepgram**: Authentication verification
- **Others**: Format and basic connectivity
