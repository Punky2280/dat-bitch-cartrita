# Cartrita MCP Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through migrating from Cartrita v2 architecture to the new Hierarchical MCP (Master Control Program) v3 system. The migration is designed to be **zero-downtime** with full backward compatibility.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 0: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Set up MCP infrastructure without disrupting existing services.

**Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Created MCP database schema (integrates with existing PostgreSQL)
- [x] Implemented MCP core libraries (TypeScript + Python)
- [x] Generated Protobuf schemas and transport layers
- [x] Set up OpenTelemetry integration
- [x] Created Docker and Kubernetes configurations
- [x] Implemented security and audit layers

**Verification Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check database schema
PGPASSWORD=punky1 psql -h localhost -U robert -d dat-bitch-cartrita -c "\d mcp_*"

# 2. Verify MCP packages
npm list @cartrita/mcp-core @cartrita/mcp-orchestrator

# 3. Test protobuf generation
cd proto && ./generate.sh

# 4. Check Docker services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml config
```

### Phase 1: Orchestrator Deployment (Week 2)

**Objective**: Deploy MCP Orchestrator alongside existing backend.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Deploy MCP Orchestrator on port 8002
- [ ] Configure routing and authentication
- [ ] Set up monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Implement v2→v3 API bridge
- [ ] Test backward compatibility

**Implementation:**
```bash
# 1. Build and deploy orchestrator
cd packages/orchestrator
npm run build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d mcp-orchestrator

# 2. Verify orchestrator health
curl http://localhost:8002/health

# 3. Test v2 compatibility bridge
curl http://localhost:8002/api/health  # Should proxy to v2 backend
```

**Expected Results:**
- MCP Orchestrator running on port 8002
- All existing v2 endpoints remain functional on port 8001
- New v3 endpoints available with enhanced features
- Monitoring dashboards showing both systems

**Rollback Plan:**
- Stop MCP Orchestrator container
- All traffic continues through existing backend
- No data loss or service interruption

### Phase 2: Supervisor Implementation (Week 3-4)

**Objective**: Deploy Tier-1 supervisors and begin routing tasks through MCP.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Deploy Intelligence Supervisor
- [ ] Deploy Multi-Modal Supervisor
- [ ] Deploy System Supervisor
- [ ] Configure task routing rules
- [ ] Implement cost management
- [ ] Set up quality gates

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Deploy supervisors
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mcp.yml up -d \
  mcp-supervisor-intelligence \
  mcp-supervisor-multimodal \
  mcp-supervisor-system

# Test task routing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/v3/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "taskType": "huggingface.text.summarization",
    "parameters": {"text": "Test summarization text..."}
  }'
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All supervisors healthy and processing tasks
- Task routing working correctly based on task types
- Cost tracking and budgets enforced
- Quality gates validating responses

### Phase 3: Agent Migration (Week 5-6)

**Objective**: Wrap existing agents as MCP-compatible Tier-2 sub-agents.

**Current Agents to Wrap:**
```javascript
// Intelligence Agents

├── KnowledgeGraphAgent.js      → memory.knowledge_graph.*
├── LearningAdapterAgent.js     → memory.learning.adapt
└── ContextMemoryAgent.js       → memory.context.*
```

**Migration Script:**
```bash
# Run agent wrapper generation
node scripts/migrate-agents-to-mcp.js

# Test wrapped agents
npm run test:mcp-agents

# Verify task routing to new wrappers
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/v3/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"taskType": "writer.compose", "parameters": {"topic": "AI"}}'
```

### Phase 4: Legacy Routing (Week 7)

**Objective**: Gradually route v2 requests through MCP while maintaining compatibility.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Canary Routing**: Route 10% of v2 traffic through MCP bridge
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare response quality and performance
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Increase to 50%, then 100% over 2 weeks
4. **Monitoring**: Track error rates, latency, and user satisfaction

**Configuration:**
```javascript
// packages/orchestrator/src/bridge/mcp-bridge.ts
export const CANARY_CONFIG = {
  enableCanary: true,
  canaryPercentage: process.env.MCP_CANARY_PERCENT || 10,
  enabledEndpoints: [
    '/api/chat',      // Start with chat endpoint
    '/api/research',  // Add research endpoint
    // Gradually add more endpoints
  ]
};
```

**Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor canary performance
curl http://localhost:8002/health | jq '.canary'

# View Grafana dashboard
open http://localhost:3002/d/mcp-canary
```

### Phase 5: Full Migration (Week 8)

**Objective**: Complete migration to MCP architecture.

**Final Steps:**
- [ ] Route 100% of traffic through MCP
- [ ] Deprecate v2 direct endpoints (with 301 redirects)
- [ ] Update frontend to use v3 API
- [ ] Publish migration completion metrics
- [ ] Plan v2 infrastructure decommissioning (6 months)

**Verification:**
```bash
# All traffic should flow through MCP
curl -I http://localhost:8001/api/chat  # Should return 301 redirect

# v3 API fully functional
curl http://localhost:8002/v3/tasks -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Performance metrics acceptable
curl http://localhost:8002/metrics | grep mcp_response_time
```
