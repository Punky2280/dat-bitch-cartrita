```

#### 2. **Role-Based Prompting**

```
"As a senior software architect, review this code architecture and provide feedback on scalability, maintainability, and performance considerations."
```

#### 3. **Format Specification**

```
"Provide your response in this format:
- Summary: [brief overview]
- Details: [detailed analysis]
- Action Items: [specific next steps]
- Resources: [helpful links or tools]"
```

### **Advanced Level Techniques**

## üõ† Multi-Agent Tool Usage

### **Single Agent, Single Tool**

```javascript
// Basic agent call with one tool
const result = await coreAgent.delegateToAgent(
  'writer',
  'Create a blog post about AI',
  userId
);
```

### **Single Agent, Multiple Tools**

```javascript
// Advanced: Agent using multiple tools in sequence
const researchPrompt = `
Use these tools in sequence:
1. Search the web for latest AI trends
2. Query Wolfram Alpha for statistical data
3. Generate a comprehensive report combining both sources
`;

const result = await coreAgent.delegateToAgent(
  'researcher',
  researchPrompt,
  userId
);
```

### **Multiple Agents, Coordinated Tasks**

```javascript
// Workflow using multiple agents
const workflowData = {
  nodes: [
    {
      id: 'research',
      type: 'mcp-researcher',
      data: { prompt: 'Research market trends for electric vehicles' },
    },
    {
      id: 'analyze',
      type: 'mcp-analyst',
      data: { prompt: 'Analyze the research data from the previous step' },
    },
    {
      id: 'write',
      type: 'mcp-writer',
      data: { prompt: 'Create a market report based on the analysis' },
    },
  ],
  edges: [
    { source: 'research', target: 'analyze' },
    { source: 'analyze', target: 'write' },
  ],
};

const result = await workflowEngine.executeWorkflow(
  workflowId,
  userId,
  {},
  'manual'
);
```

### **Parallel Multi-Agent Processing**

```javascript
// Execute multiple agents simultaneously
const tasks = await Promise.all([
  coreAgent.delegateToAgent('writer', 'Create marketing copy', userId),
  coreAgent.delegateToAgent('designer', 'Design layout suggestions', userId),
  coreAgent.delegateToAgent('analyst', 'Analyze target audience', userId),
]);
```

## üìà Advanced Prompting Strategies

### **1. Contextual Priming**

```
"You are working on a fintech application where accuracy is critical and any errors could result in financial losses. With this context in mind, review this payment processing code for potential issues."
```

### **2. Constraint-Based Prompting**

```
"Design a solution that must meet these constraints:
- Budget: Under $10,000
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Team: 3 developers
- Technology: Must use existing React infrastructure
- Performance: Page load under 2 seconds"
```

### **3. Iterative Refinement**

```
"Start with a basic solution, then iterate:
1. Create a simple MVP approach
2. Identify potential improvements
3. Add advanced features
4. Optimize for performance
5. Consider edge cases"
```

### **4. Perspective-Taking**

```
"Approach this from three different perspectives:
1. As a end user: What would you want?
2. As a developer: What are the technical challenges?
3. As a business owner: What are the cost implications?"
```

## üé® Creative Combination Techniques

### **Cross-Agent Workflows**

```javascript
// Creative + Technical combination
const creativeFlow = {
  step1: 'ArtistAgent: Generate creative concept for user dashboard',
  step2: 'DesignAgent: Convert concept into UI/UX specifications',
  step3: 'CodeWriterAgent: Implement the design in React',
  step4: 'SecurityAuditAgent: Review for security vulnerabilities',
};
```

### **Layered Analysis**

```
"Perform a layered analysis:
1. ResearcherAgent: Gather raw data and facts
2. AnalyticsAgent: Interpret data statistically
3. WriterAgent: Present findings in accessible language
4. BiasDetectionAgent: Review for potential biases"
```

### **Feedback Loops**

```
"Create an iterative improvement cycle:
1. CodeWriterAgent: Write initial implementation
2. SecurityAuditAgent: Identify security issues
3. CodeWriterAgent: Fix identified issues
4. Repeat until security standards are met"
```

## üîß Tool Integration Examples

### **Knowledge Hub + Workflows**

```javascript
// Search knowledge base, then create workflow based on findings
const searchResult = await knowledgeHub.semanticSearch(
  userId,
  'project management best practices'
);
const workflowPrompt = `Based on these knowledge base findings: ${searchResult.results}, create a project management workflow`;
```

### **API Vault + Agent Integration**

```javascript
// Use stored API keys for agent operations
const apiKey = await vault.getDecryptedKey(userId, 'openai');
const agent = new WriterAgent({ apiKey });
```

### **Life OS + Settings Integration**

```javascript
// Personalize agent responses based on user preferences
const userSettings = await settings.getUserSettings(userId);
const personalizedPrompt = `Adjust your communication style: sarcasm level ${userSettings.sarcasm_level}, verbosity ${userSettings.verbosity}`;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### **Problem: Vague Prompts**

```
‚ùå Bad: "Make this better"
‚úÖ Good: "Improve code readability by adding comments, reducing complexity, and following Python PEP 8 standards"
```

### **Problem: Overloading Single Prompt**

```
‚ùå Bad: "Write code, test it, document it, deploy it, and monitor it"
‚úÖ Good: Break into separate agent calls or use workflow system
```

### **Problem: Ignoring Agent Specialization**

```
‚ùå Bad: Using WriterAgent for mathematical calculations
‚úÖ Good: Use AnalyticsAgent with Wolfram Alpha integration
```

### **Problem: No Error Handling**

```
‚ùå Bad: Assuming all agent calls succeed
‚úÖ Good: Implement try-catch and fallback strategies
```

---

## üèÜ Expert-Level Integration Patterns

### **Adaptive Agent Selection**

```javascript
// Dynamically choose best agent based on task analysis
function selectOptimalAgent(taskDescription) {
  if (
    taskDescription.includes('code') ||
    taskDescription.includes('programming')
  ) {
    return 'codewriter';
  } else if (
    taskDescription.includes('research') ||
    taskDescription.includes('analyze')
  ) {
    return 'researcher';
  } else if (
    taskDescription.includes('write') ||
    taskDescription.includes('content')
  ) {
    return 'writer';
  }
  return 'core'; // fallback
}
```

### **Context-Aware Prompting**

```javascript
// Maintain conversation context across agents
class ContextAwareAgentManager {
  constructor() {
    this.conversationContext = new Map();
  }

  async callAgentWithContext(agentType, prompt, userId) {
    const context = this.conversationContext.get(userId) || '';
    const enrichedPrompt = `Context: ${context}\nCurrent Task: ${prompt}`;

    const result = await coreAgent.delegateToAgent(
      agentType,
      enrichedPrompt,
      userId
    );

    // Update context
    this.conversationContext.set(
      userId,
      `${context}\nCompleted: ${prompt}\nResult: ${result.summary}`
    );

    return result;
  }
}
```

### **Quality Assurance Chain**

```javascript
// Multi-agent quality assurance
async function qualityAssuranceChain(content, userId) {
  // Step 1: Security review
  const securityResult = await coreAgent.delegateToAgent(
    'security',
    `Review this content for security issues: ${content}`,
    userId
  );

  // Step 2: Bias detection
  const biasResult = await coreAgent.delegateToAgent(
    'bias',
    `Check for bias in: ${content}`,
    userId
  );

  // Step 3: Final review
  if (securityResult.issues.length === 0 && biasResult.biasScore < 0.3) {
    return { approved: true, content };
  } else {
    // Auto-fix issues
    const fixedContent = await coreAgent.delegateToAgent(
      'writer',
      `Fix these issues in the content: ${[
        ...securityResult.issues,
        ...biasResult.concerns,
      ].join(', ')}`,
      userId
    );

    return { approved: true, content: fixedContent };
  }
}
```
