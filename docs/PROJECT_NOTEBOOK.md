**Frontend: React + TypeScript**
- **Pros:** Mature ecosystem, excellent developer experience, strong typing
- **Cons:** Bundle size (mitigated by code splitting and lazy loading)
- **Alternative Considered:** Vue.js (rejected due to smaller ecosystem)

**Database: PostgreSQL + pgvector**
- **Pros:** ACID compliance, vector search, JSON support, mature ecosystem
- **Cons:** Scaling complexity (mitigated by read replicas and sharding plan)
- **Alternatives Considered:** MongoDB (rejected due to consistency concerns)

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Communication Protocol

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation:**
```typescript
interface MCPMessage {
  id: string;
  type: 'task_request' | 'task_response' | 'handoff' | 'error';
  source_agent: string;
  target_agent?: string;
  payload: any;
  context?: ConversationContext;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface ConversationContext {
  user_id: string;
  conversation_id: string;
  previous_agents: string[];
  shared_memory: Record<string, any>;
  tool_permissions: string[];
}
```

**Agent Orchestration Flow:**
1. User input received by chat interface
2. Intent analysis determines optimal agent
3. Context and tools prepared for agent
4. Agent processes request using available tools
5. Response generated and returned to user
6. Context updated for future interactions

### Security Implementation

**Encryption System:**
```typescript
class EncryptionService {
  private masterKey: Buffer;
  private keyRotationInterval: number = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours
  
  async encrypt(data: string, keyId?: string): Promise<EncryptedData> {
    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
    const salt = crypto.randomBytes(32);
    const key = await this.deriveKey(keyId || 'current', salt);
    
    const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-gcm', key);
    cipher.setAAD(Buffer.from(keyId || 'current'));
    
    let encrypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
    
    const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
    
    return {
      encrypted,
      iv: iv.toString('hex'),
      salt: salt.toString('hex'),
      authTag: authTag.toString('hex'),
      keyId: keyId || 'current'
    };
  }
}
```

**API Key Vault Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_api_keys (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    provider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    key_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    encrypted_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    key_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    category TEXT,
    rotation_policy JSONB DEFAULT '{"intervalDays":90,"autoRotate":false}',
    visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'MASKED',
    checksum TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    needs_rotation BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    last_validated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    validation_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'never_tested',
    UNIQUE(user_id, provider_name, key_name)
);
```

### Performance Optimizations

**Caching Strategy:**
- **Redis:** Session data, frequently accessed configurations

- **Database:** Query result caching with invalidation triggers
- **CDN:** Static assets, public documentation

**Response Time Optimization:**
- **WebSocket Preconnection:** Maintain persistent connections
- **Predictive Loading:** Preload likely-needed resources
- **Streaming Responses:** Send partial responses as they're generated
- **Background Processing:** Queue non-critical operations

**Resource Management:**
- **Worker Threads:** CPU-intensive operations (encryption, vector calculations)
- **Connection Pooling:** Database connections with automatic scaling
- **Rate Limiting:** Per-user and per-endpoint limits with backoff
- **Memory Management:** Automatic garbage collection tuning
