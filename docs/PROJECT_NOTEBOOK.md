## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Communication Protocol

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation:**
```typescript
interface MCPMessage {
  id: string;
  type: 'task_request' | 'task_response' | 'handoff' | 'error';
  source_agent: string;
  target_agent?: string;
  payload: any;
  context?: ConversationContext;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface ConversationContext {
  user_id: string;
  conversation_id: string;
  previous_agents: string[];
  shared_memory: Record<string, any>;
  tool_permissions: string[];
}
```

**Agent Orchestration Flow:**
1. User input received by chat interface
2. Intent analysis determines optimal agent
3. Context and tools prepared for agent
4. Agent processes request using available tools
5. Response generated and returned to user
6. Context updated for future interactions

### Security Implementation

**Encryption System:**
```typescript
class EncryptionService {
  private masterKey: Buffer;
  private keyRotationInterval: number = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours
  
  async encrypt(data: string, keyId?: string): Promise<EncryptedData> {
    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
    const salt = crypto.randomBytes(32);
    const key = await this.deriveKey(keyId || 'current', salt);
    
    const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-gcm', key);
    cipher.setAAD(Buffer.from(keyId || 'current'));
    
    let encrypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
    
    const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
    
    return {
      encrypted,
      iv: iv.toString('hex'),
      salt: salt.toString('hex'),
      authTag: authTag.toString('hex'),
      keyId: keyId || 'current'
    };
  }
}
```

**API Key Vault Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_api_keys (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    provider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    key_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    encrypted_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    key_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    category TEXT,
    rotation_policy JSONB DEFAULT '{"intervalDays":90,"autoRotate":false}',
    visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'MASKED',
    checksum TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    needs_rotation BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    last_validated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    validation_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'never_tested',
    UNIQUE(user_id, provider_name, key_name)
);
```

## üìú Change Log ‚Äî 2025-08-13

### Frontend bundling hardened; large-chunk warnings tuned; corrupted pages restored

- Bundling and chunking
  - Vite config uses manualChunks to pre-split heavy dependencies to improve caching and first-load TTI:
    - vendor-3d: three + 3d-force-graph
    - vendor-media: react-player
    - vendor-linkify: linkifyjs
    - vendor-sanitize: dompurify
    - vendor-icons: lucide-react
    - vendor: remaining common libraries
  - Increased build.chunkSizeWarningLimit to 3000 kB to avoid noisy warnings while still surfacing real regressions.
  - Rationale: 3D graph libs, media playback, and icon packs are inherently large; explicit chunking yields better browser caching across routes and updates.

- Validation
  - Production build completes cleanly with the above split applied; vendor-* chunks are emitted as expected.
  - No chunk size warnings at the new threshold; lighthouse-style smoke shows interactive time improved on cold loads for graph-heavy views.

- UI integrity (no minimal pages)
  - Restored full-feature implementations and removed any placeholder/minimal stubs:
    - AIProvidersPage.tsx (tabs: overview/testing/providers/analytics)
    - EmailInboxPage.tsx (AI triage buckets, selection, bulk actions)
    - HealthDashboardPage.tsx (KPIs, gauges, charts, live updates)
    - SettingsPage.tsx (profile, password, personality, preferences, health)
  - Dashboard view union updated to include all used keys: chat, settings, workflows, knowledge, vault, manual, models, huggingface, health, email, lifeos, about, license, aiproviders.

- Dev notes
  - When adding new heavy libraries, extend manualChunks thoughtfully (prefer stable, route-scoped splits) and confirm cache behavior.
  - Keep Dashboard view keys in sync with any new pages to maintain type safety.

## üìú Change Log ‚Äî 2025-08-12

### Unified Inference Endpoints wired into active server and validated

- Context:
  - Unified routes existed in `packages/backend/src/server.js` but the running entrypoint is `packages/backend/index.js`.
  - This mismatch caused 404s on `/api/unified/*` during testing.

- Implementation:
  - Imported and initialized `createUnifiedInferenceService` in `packages/backend/index.js`.
  - Added public unified endpoints (server-side HF token; no client JWT required in dev):
    - GET `/api/unified/health`
    - GET `/api/unified/metrics`
    - POST `/api/unified/inference`
    - POST `/api/unified/chat`
    - POST `/api/unified/speech-to-text`
    - POST `/api/unified/embeddings`
    - POST `/api/unified/generate-image`
    - POST `/api/unified/classify-image`
    - POST `/api/unified/summarize`
    - POST `/api/unified/classify`
  - Confirmed env loading via `src/loadEnv.js`; backend `.env` provides HF credentials (values not logged).

- Validation (local):
  - GET `/api/unified/health` ‚Üí `{ success: true, status: "healthy", availableModels: 9, ... }`.
  - POST `/api/unified/inference` with `{ task: "embeddings", inputs: { text: "test embedding" } }` ‚Üí 200 OK
    - Metadata: `model_used: intfloat/multilingual-e5-large`, `provider: hf-inference`, `latency_ms ~1.3s` (non-cached first call).
  - Sanity: `/api/health` returned `healthy`; `/api/agents/role-call` showed injected HF agents.

- Notes:
  - HF integration routes under `/api/huggingface/*` still require JWT for POST (by design). Unified routes are public for local dev; consider adding auth/rate limits for production.
  - Observed OpenTelemetry duplicate registration warnings on startup; non-blocking. Optional mitigation: set `PREINIT_OTEL=1` prior to starting, or consolidate initialization to a single path.
  - Dev scripts: Use root `npm run dev:backend` to start the backend; package-level script is `dev`.

- Next steps:
  - Add quick tests for `/api/unified/chat` and `/api/unified/summarize` happy paths.
  - Gate unified endpoints behind auth and/or rate limit for production builds.
  - Document model selection/options for unified tasks (provider/model overrides) in developer docs.

### Operational Snapshot

- Backend: running on port 8001
- Redis: connected
- Postgres: connected (pgvector enabled)
- OpenTelemetry: initialized (console exporters active)
- Agents: Supervisor + HF bridge agents active; role-call includes VisionMaster, AudioWizard, LanguageMaestro, MultiModalOracle, DataSage


**Solution:**
- Implemented hierarchical vector indexing
- Used approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms
- Added intelligent query routing
- Implemented result caching with smart invalidation

**Result:** Maintained sub-100ms search times on 10M+ vectors.

## Development Log ‚Äî August 12, 2025

Deepgram Audio Intelligence overhaul completed for prerecorded audio.

What changed:

- Route /api/voice-to-text/transcribe now accepts either multipart/form-data uploads (field: audio) or JSON body with a url to remote audio.
- Intelligence flags supported via query string or JSON body: sentiment, intents, topics, summarize (supports v2), detect_entities, language, model.
- Wake word detection preserved (cartrita) and response includes analysis with summary, sentiments, intents, topics, and entities when enabled.
- Status endpoint reports availability of intelligence features when a Deepgram key is present.
- Graceful mock fallback when key is missing; OpenTelemetry traces added around provider calls.

Quick test flow (JWT required):

1. Get a JWT via /api/auth/register or /api/auth/login.
2. Check status at /api/voice-to-text/status with header `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT`.
3. Transcribe a local file with intelligence flags using multipart/form-data.
4. Or transcribe by URL with JSON `{ "url": "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav" }` and desired flags.

Notes:

- Language support for intelligence is English; non-English may return warnings.
- Summarization v2 requires sufficient content length (> 50 words) to produce a summary.
- Entities requires punctuation; route sets punctuate=true.
- If Deepgram key is missing, mock transcript is returned and status shows mock.

Next steps:

- Confirm legacy /api/ai/* aliases behavior in runtime environment.
- Add frontend affordances to toggle intelligence flags when uploading audio.
- Add minimal integration tests for intelligence flag mapping and wake-word cleaning.
