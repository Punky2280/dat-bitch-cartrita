- **Resource Management**: CPU/Memory optimization

### Agent Communication Flow
```
User Input → MCPCoordinatorAgent → Relevant Specialist Agents → Response Synthesis → User Output
```

### Sub-Agent Hierarchies
- **Consciousness agents** contain sub-agents for memory, ethics checks
- **Ethics agents** monitor all other agent activities
- **Memory agents** serve as shared knowledge stores
