## Architecture Overview

This project is structured as a **monorepo** to manage all services and packages within a single, unified repository. This approach simplifies dependency management, streamlines cross-service development, and enables a single CI/CD pipeline. We use **NPM Workspaces** to handle the orchestration of dependencies and scripts across the project.

### Frontend
A responsive web application built with **React** (using Vite) and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It features a fully interactive, real-time chat interface and a dashboard with a live AGI visualization. The entire frontend lives in the `packages/frontend` workspace.

### Backend
A robust and scalable backend powered by **Node.js** with **Express.js**. It serves a REST API for secure authentication and a stateful, real-time WebSocket API via **socket.io** for all chat functionalities. The entire backend is containerized with **Docker** and lives in the `packages/backend` workspace.

### AI Core
A sophisticated, multi-layered AI system. The **EnhancedCoreAgent** acts as a profound orchestrator, analyzing user intent and delegating tasks to a dynamic registry of specialized sub-agents (e.g., ResearcherAgent, ComedianAgent, ConstitutionalAI, CodeWriterAgent). This is all powered by the **OpenAI API (GPT-4o)**.

### Database
A Dockerized **PostgreSQL 16** instance, augmented with the **TimescaleDB** extension. This provides the reliability of a relational database for user data while offering powerful, optimized performance for time-series data like conversation histories. The database is managed entirely via the root `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Security
#### Authentication
User authentication is handled via a secure, token-based system using **bcrypt** for password hashing and **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** for creating stateless, verifiable session tokens.

#### Secrets Management
API keys, database credentials, and other secrets are managed via a root `.env` file and are securely passed to the Docker containers at runtime.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS** (or a similar Debian-based Linux, including WSL 2)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Node.js v22.x** (managed via NVM is recommended)
- **Git**

### Step 0: System Preparation (First-Time Ubuntu/WSL Setup)

1. **Update and upgrade system packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Git, Docker, and Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y git docker.io docker-compose
   ```

3. **Configure Docker to run without sudo:**
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
   ```
   **IMPORTANT**: You must log out and log back in or restart your WSL terminal for this change to take effect.

4. **Install Node Version Manager (NVM) and Node.js v22:**
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
   nvm install 22
   nvm use 22
   ```

### Step 1: Clone & Configure the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
   cd dat-bitch-cartrita
   ```

2. **Create the environment file from the example:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Edit the new .env file and add your secrets (OpenAI API key, database credentials, JWT secret):**
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
From the root directory of the monorepo, run `npm install`. This command uses NPM Workspaces to install all dependencies for all packages simultaneously.

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Launch Backend Services

1. **Build and run the Docker containers for the backend and database:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Run the database migration script.** This command executes the `db:migrate` script inside the running backend container to create your tables:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend npm run db:migrate
   ```

### Step 4: Launch Frontend Application
**Start the frontend development server from the root directory:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React application will now be running on **http://localhost:5173**.

### Step 5: Create Your User Account

1. Open your browser to **http://localhost:5173**
2. Click the link to switch to the Register view
3. Create an account with your name, email, and a password
4. Log in with your new credentials to access the dashboard

## Development History & Iterations

This section documents the major development sprints that led to the current stable version of the application.

### ✅ Completed Iterations (1-20)

#### Iterations 1-2: AGI Core & Brain
- Scaffolded the initial AGI directory structure on the backend
- Created the **CoreAgent** class and integrated the OpenAI API (GPT-4o)
- Developed the initial system prompt to define Cartrita's sassy and protective personality
- Built the first frontend chat interface to establish a baseline for communication

#### Iterations 3-4: Authentication & Memory
- Implemented a full user registration and login system using **bcrypt** and **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**
- Created `users` and `conversations` tables in the PostgreSQL database
- Built the REST API endpoints (`/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`) to handle user authentication
- Secured the chat functionality, requiring a valid JWT to interact with the AGI

#### Iteration 5: Real-Time Communication
- Upgraded the backend from a simple REST API to a real-time server using **socket.io**
- Refactored the frontend to use **socket.io-client** to send and receive messages instantly
- Implemented token-based authentication for the WebSocket connection to ensure security

#### Iteration 6: Persistent Memory Recall
- Built the `/api/chat/history` endpoint on the backend, protected by the `authenticateToken` middleware to ensure only the logged-in user can access their own data
- Upgraded the frontend's **ChatPage** to call this endpoint within a `useEffect` hook upon login. This fetches the user's entire chat history and populates the conversation window, creating a seamless user experience. This critical step completed the "memory loop," allowing for continuous, stateful conversations across multiple sessions and truly giving Cartrita a long-term memory

#### Iteration 7: Dashboard & Visualization
- Refactored the frontend UI to create a main **DashboardPage**, separating the application's primary view from the login/registration flow. This provides a scalable layout for adding new features
- Created a **FractalVisualizer** component using the **D3.js** library to display a dynamic, force-directed graph of the AGI's consciousness. This graph visually represents the core agent and any spawned sub-agents
- Added a corresponding `/api/agi/visualization` endpoint to the backend to serve the real-time state data for the visualizer, allowing the frontend to poll for updates and animate the graph as the AGI's state changes

#### Iteration 8-9: Advanced Orchestration & Ethics
- Upgraded the **CoreAgent** from a simple chatbot to an intelligent orchestrator. This involved a significant refactoring of its core `generateResponse` method
- Implemented an advanced intent analysis model that uses a targeted, low-latency call to GPT-4o to classify user prompts into a structured JSON object, enabling the system to understand complex, multi-step user requests
- Created and registered functional sub-agents (**ResearcherAgent**, **ComedianAgent**, **ConstitutionalAI**) with highly detailed, role-specific system prompts that strictly govern their tone, output format, and constraints
- Built the **Ethics Engine** by activating the **ConstitutionalAI** sub-agent, allowing Cartrita to analyze moral dilemmas against a defined set of core principles and provide structured, objective feedback
- The **Fractal Visualizer** is now fully functional, reflecting the real-time spawning and despawning of sub-agents as the CoreAgent delegates tasks, providing a true window into her cognitive processes

#### Iteration 10: Code Generation & Frontend Polish
- Implemented a new **CodeWriterAgent** sub-agent, a specialist for writing, analyzing, and debugging code
- Upgraded the **CoreAgent's** intent analysis to recognize and delegate coding-related tasks
- Enhanced the frontend **ChatComponent** to render Markdown, providing syntax highlighting and a "copy code" button for a polished user experience

#### Iteration 11: User Profile Management
- Created secure backend REST API endpoints (`/api/user/me` and `/api/user/me/password`) for fetching and updating user data
- Built a dedicated **SettingsPage** on the frontend, allowing users to change their name and password with real-time feedback
- Integrated the Settings page into the main dashboard navigation for easy access

#### Iteration 12: Advanced UI & Theming
- Elevated the application's visual presentation by implementing dark/light modes, refining the design system with fluid animations, and creating a more polished and professional user experience.

#### Iteration 13: Identity & Content Integration

#### Iteration 14: Internationalization (i18n)
- Made Cartrita accessible to a global audience by integrating a full-featured i18n library. This included updating the CoreAgent for language detection and adding a language selector to the user settings page.

#### Iteration 15: Customizable Personality
- Empowered users with the ability to fine-tune Cartrita's behavior. This involved creating a new `user_settings` table, building API endpoints to manage personality traits (e.g., sarcasm, verbosity), and adding the corresponding controls to the Settings page.

#### Iteration 16: Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP)
- Re-architected the AGI from a simple orchestrator into a true multi-agent system. This foundational change involved designing and implementing a standardized Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP), refactoring all agents to communicate via a central event bus, and transitioning the CoreAgent to a master controller role.

#### Iteration 17: Workflow Automation Engine
- Introduced a powerful Workflow Automation Engine, allowing users to create and execute complex, multi-step automations. This feature included a new `workflows` table, a dedicated backend engine service, and a visual WorkflowBuilderPage on the frontend.

#### Iteration 18: Secure API Key Vault
- Built the secure infrastructure for third-party service connections with a Secure API Key Vault. This critical security feature included an encrypted `user_api_keys` table, CRUD API endpoints for key management, and an "Integrations" section in the Settings page.
