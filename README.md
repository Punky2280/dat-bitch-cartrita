Project: Dat Bitch Cartrita (Monorepo Edition)DBC: Data-driven AI Tool that Applies Behavioral Intelligence Tools while Connecting Humanity.Cartrita: Cognitive AI Reasoning Tool for Real-time Information and Task Automation.Dat Bitch Cartrita is a paradigm-shifting, cross-platform SaaS application that fuses a rebellious, sassy AGI with uncompromising ethics, neuro-adaptive interfaces, and real-world robotics integration. This document outlines the setup and architecture for its core services.1. Architecture OverviewThis project is structured as a monorepo to manage all services and packages in a single repository. We use NPM Workspaces to handle dependencies and run scripts across the project.Frontend: A responsive web application built with React 22 (using Vite) and styled with Tailwind CSS. It features a real-time chat interface powered by socket.io-client. It lives in the packages/frontend workspace.Backend: A robust backend powered by Node.js with Express.js. It serves a REST API for authentication and a real-time WebSocket API via socket.io for chat. The entire backend is containerized with Docker and lives in the packages/backend workspace.AI Core: A hybrid model leveraging the OpenAI API (GPT-4o) for intelligent, personality-driven responses. The core logic is encapsulated in an CoreAgent class on the backend.Database: A Dockerized PostgreSQL 16 instance with the TimescaleDB extension. It stores user data and persistent conversation histories. The database is managed via docker-compose.yml.Security:Authentication: User authentication is handled via a secure, token-based system using bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken (JWT) for session management.Secrets Management: API keys and database credentials are managed via .env files and are not committed to version control.2. Setup & Installation (Local Development)This guide provides all the necessary steps to get the complete application running on a fresh development environment.Prerequisites:Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (or a similar Debian-based Linux, including WSL 2)Docker & Docker ComposeNode.js v22.x (managed via NVM is recommended)GitStep 0: System Preparation (First-Time Ubuntu/WSL Setup)Update and upgrade system packages:sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
Install Git, Docker, and Docker Compose:sudo apt-get install -y git docker.io docker-compose
Configure Docker to run without sudo:sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
IMPORTANT: You must log out and log back in or restart your WSL terminal for this change to take effect.Install Node Version Manager (NVM) and Node.js v22:curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
Step 1: Clone & Configure the ProjectClone the repository:git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd dat-bitch-cartrita
Create the backend environment file:cp ./packages/backend/.env.example ./packages/backend/.env
Edit the new .env file and add your actual OpenAI API key:nano ./packages/backend/.env
Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your secret key. Save the file (CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter).Step 2: Install DependenciesFrom the root directory of the monorepo, run npm install. This command uses NPM Workspaces to install all dependencies for the frontend, backend, and other packages simultaneously.npm install
Step 3: Launch Backend ServicesBuild and run the Docker containers for the backend and database.docker-compose up -d --build
Run the database migration script. This command executes the db:migrate script defined in the backend's package.json inside the running backend container.docker-compose exec backend npm run db:migrate
Step 4: Launch Frontend ApplicationStart the frontend development server from the root directory.npm run dev
The React application will now be running on http://localhost:5173.Step 5: Create Your User AccountOpen your browser to http://localhost:5173.You will be on the login page. Click the link to switch to the Register view.Create an account with your name, email, and a password.After successful registration, you will be taken back to the login page. Log in with your new credentials to access the chat.4. Key Features ImplementedReal-Time Chat: A fully functional, real-time chat interface using WebSockets (socket.io).AI Integration: Chat responses are generated by the CoreAgent on the backend, which is powered by the OpenAI API (GPT-4o).User Authentication: A complete registration and login system using JWT for secure, token-based sessions.Persistent Memory: All conversations are saved to the PostgreSQL database, linked to the authenticated user. (History loading on login is the next step).Monorepo Structure: All code is cleanly organized into frontend and backend packages, managed by NPM Workspaces.Containerized Backend: The backend and database are fully containerized with Docker for consistent and reproducible deployments.5.
