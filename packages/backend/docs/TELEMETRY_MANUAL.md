## Getting Started

### Basic Commands

The Telemetry Agent responds to natural language commands. Simply describe what telemetry operation you want to perform.

#### Status Check
```
"Check telemetry status"
"What's the health of the telemetry system?"
"Show telemetry system status"
```

#### Getting Help
```
"Show telemetry manual"
"Help with telemetry operations"
"What telemetry operations are available?"
```

#### Quick Test
```
"Create a demo trace"
"Show current metrics"
"Check system performance"
```

---

## Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing allows you to follow requests as they flow through different parts of the Cartrita system, providing visibility into performance bottlenecks and system behavior.

### Creating Custom Traces

#### Basic Trace Creation
```
"Create a trace for user authentication process"
"Create a trace named 'data-processing-workflow'"
"Create a trace for agent collaboration scenario"
```

**Result:** Creates a custom trace with automatic child spans and instrumentation.

#### Trace with Custom Attributes
```
"Create a trace for order processing with attributes {'user_id': '12345', 'order_type': 'premium'}"
```

**Advanced Example:**
```
"Create a trace for multi-modal processing with attributes {'modality': 'vision', 'model': 'gpt-4-vision', 'complexity': 'high'}"
```

### Analyzing Traces

#### Recent Trace Analysis
```
"Analyze traces from the last hour"
"Analyze traces from the last day"
"Show trace analysis for recent operations"
```

**Output Includes:**
- Trace count and distribution
- Average, p95, p99 response times
- Error rates and patterns
- Service dependency mapping
- Performance bottlenecks identification

#### Demo Scenarios
```
"Demo a multi-agent workflow trace"
"Demo an API request trace scenario"
"Show a database interaction trace example"
```

### Trace Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, hierarchical naming
   - ✅ `agent.researcher.web-search`
   - ❌ `operation1`

2. **Meaningful Attributes**: Add context that aids debugging
   - ✅ `{'user.id': 'user123', 'query.type': 'semantic', 'model.version': 'v2.1'}`
   - ❌ `{'data': 'some_value'}`

3. **Appropriate Span Kinds**: 
   - `SERVER`: For handling incoming requests
   - `CLIENT`: For outgoing requests
   - `INTERNAL`: For internal operations

## Custom Metrics

Custom metrics provide quantitative insights into your system's behavior, performance, and business outcomes.

### Counter Metrics

Counters measure things that only increase (requests, errors, events).

#### Creating Counters
```
"Create a counter named user_actions_total"
"Create a counter for agent_operations_count"
"Create a counter named 'api_requests_total' with description 'Total API requests received'"
```

#### Recording Counter Values
```
"Record metric user_actions_total with value 1"
"Increment counter agent_operations_count"
```

### Histogram Metrics

Histograms measure distributions of values (response times, request sizes, scores).

#### Creating Histograms
```
"Create a histogram named response_time_ms"
"Create a histogram for agent_processing_duration with description 'Agent processing time in milliseconds'"
```

#### Recording Histogram Values
```
"Record metric response_time_ms with value 150"
"Record metric agent_satisfaction_score with value 8.5"
```

### Viewing Current Metrics

```
"Show current metrics"
"Show all active metrics"
"Display metrics summary"
```

### Metric Naming Conventions

Follow these patterns for consistency:

- **Counters**: `{component}_{action}_total`
  - `user_sessions_total`
  - `agent_errors_total`
  - `api_requests_total`

- **Histograms**: `{component}_{measurement}_{unit}`
  - `response_time_ms`
  - `agent_processing_duration_ms`
  - `user_satisfaction_score`

- **Gauges**: `{component}_{current_state}`
  - `active_connections`
  - `memory_usage_bytes`
  - `queue_size`

## Best Practices

### Tracing Best Practices

1. **Meaningful Span Names**
   - Use hierarchical naming: `service.component.operation`
   - Be specific: `agent.researcher.web-search` vs `search`

2. **Relevant Attributes**
   - Add context that helps with debugging
   - Use consistent attribute naming
   - Avoid high-cardinality values (user IDs in attributes)

3. **Proper Error Handling**
   - Always record exceptions in spans
   - Set appropriate span status codes
   - Include error context in attributes

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use appropriate sampling rates
   - Avoid creating too many spans for high-frequency operations
   - Consider asynchronous span processing

### Metrics Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use consistent naming patterns
   - Include units in names where applicable
   - Use descriptive suffixes (`_total`, `_duration_ms`)

2. **Label Hygiene**
   - Avoid high cardinality labels
   - Use consistent label names across metrics
   - Group related metrics with common labels

3. **Metric Types**
   - Use counters for monotonically increasing values
   - Use histograms for measuring distributions
   - Use gauges for current state values

### Performance Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Set up automated performance checks
   - Monitor trends, not just point-in-time values
   - Establish performance baselines

2. **Alerting**
   - Set meaningful thresholds
   - Avoid alert fatigue
   - Include context in alerts

3. **Analysis**
   - Look for patterns and correlations
   - Consider business context in analysis
   - Document performance optimization results
