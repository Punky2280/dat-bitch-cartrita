    "#### Priority 1: Verify Current Docker Configuration\n",
    "**URGENT**: Determine which FastAPI server is currently running in production\n",
    "- Check `docker-compose.unified.yml` Python service configuration\n",
    "- Verify port 8002 service mapping\n",
    "- Confirm startup command in Dockerfile.fastapi\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Priority 2: Replace Mock Server\n",
    "**CRITICAL**: Switch to real implementation immediately\n",
    "- Update Docker configuration to use `py/fastapi_server.py`\n",
    "- Remove all references to `py/headless_fastapi_server.py` \n",
    "- Delete mock implementation entirely\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Priority 3: Validate Real Implementation\n",
    "**HIGH**: Test all API endpoints with real MCP system\n",
    "- Test `/api/v2/chat` with real agent manager\n",
    "- Verify `/api/v2/computer-use` with OpenAI Responses API\n",
    "- Confirm agent status endpoints return real data\n",

    "### üîÑ Next Phase Transition\n",
    "**Cannot proceed with frontend redesign until backend mock elimination is complete**\n",
