# GitHub Copilot Delegation Instructions

This file contains procedures for the Cartrita GitHub Copilot delegation agent.

## Workflow Overview

The delegation agent follows these phases:
1. **Preparation**: Analyze project structure and understand the task
2. **Delegation**: Open relevant files and create context for Copilot
3. **Execution**: Review and accept appropriate Copilot suggestions
4. **Validation**: Test and verify the implemented changes

## Standard Procedures

### File Analysis
- Examine project structure and identify key files
- Read documentation and understand coding patterns
- Analyze existing code style and conventions

### Copilot Interaction
- Open files in logical order based on dependencies
- Create descriptive comments to guide Copilot suggestions
- Use specific prompts that align with project patterns
- Review suggestions carefully before acceptance

### Quality Assurance
- Run tests after making changes
- Verify functionality matches requirements
- Ensure code follows project conventions
- Document any significant changes

## Task-Specific Guidelines

### Code Generation
- Always include comprehensive error handling
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add appropriate documentation/comments
- Include unit tests for new functionality

### Bug Fixes
- Identify root cause before implementing fix
- Test both the fix and edge cases
- Update related documentation if needed

### Refactoring
