## Hierarchical Agent Architecture

Cartrita uses **LangChain StateGraph** for sophisticated agent orchestration with explicit handoffs and state management.

### üß† **Agent Hierarchy Overview**

**Supervisor Layer:**

- **Cartrita (Master Supervisor)** - Has access to ALL 40+ tools, can override any agent
- **Intent Analysis & Routing** - Determines which specialist agents to engage
- **Response Synthesis** - Combines multi-agent outputs into coherent responses

**Specialist Agent Layer:**

- **Researcher Agent** - Real web search, arXiv papers, Wikipedia, URL scraping
- **CodeWriter Agent** - AI code review, GitHub search, documentation generation
- **Artist Agent** - DALL-E 3 image generation, AI image analysis, visual editing
- **Writer Agent** - AI grammar checking, style analysis, content optimization
- **Scheduler Agent** - Google Calendar integration, timezone conversion, meeting optimization
- **TaskManager Agent** - Workflow orchestration, priority analysis, project coordination
- **Comedian Agent** - Joke generation, meme creation, humor analysis
- **Analytics Agent** - Data analysis, chart generation, statistical computations
- **Designer Agent** - UI/UX design, mockup generation, accessibility analysis
- **Security Agent** - Security audits, vulnerability assessment, compliance checking

### üîÑ **How Agent Orchestration Works**

1. **User Input Processing**: You interact with Cartrita naturally
2. **Intent Analysis**: Supervisor analyzes request and determines required capabilities
3. **Agent Selection**: StateGraph routes to appropriate specialist agent(s)
4. **Tool Execution**: Selected agents use their real tools to complete tasks
5. **State Management**: LangChain manages conversation state and context
6. **Response Coordination**: Results are synthesized into Cartrita's personality-driven response
7. **Handoff Management**: Agents can delegate to other agents using Command objects

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Permission System**

**Agent-Specific Tools**: Each specialist agent has access to relevant tools:

- Researcher: `tavily_search`, `wikipedia_search`, `arxiv_search`, `url_scraper`, etc.
- CodeWriter: `code_reviewer`, `github_search`, `calculator`, `doc_generator`, etc.
- Artist: `dalle_3`, `image_analyzer`, `visual_editor`, etc.

**Supervisor Override**: The master supervisor agent has access to ALL tools and can:

- Override any agent's limitations
- Access any tool directly when needed
- Handle emergency situations or complex multi-domain requests
- Coordinate between agents that need different tool sets

### üí¨ **Example Agent Workflows**

**Research Request**: _"Find recent papers about machine learning optimization"_

1. Supervisor routes to Researcher Agent
2. Researcher uses `arxiv_search` tool to query academic papers
3. Results processed and returned with Cartrita's personality

**Code Review**: _"Review this JavaScript function for performance issues"_

1. Supervisor routes to CodeWriter Agent
2. CodeWriter uses `code_reviewer` tool with GPT-4 analysis
3. Detailed code review returned with specific suggestions

**Multi-Agent Task**: _"Create an image of a neural network and then explain how it works"_

1. Supervisor routes to Artist Agent for image generation
2. Artist uses `dalle_3` tool to create neural network visualization
3. Supervisor then routes to Researcher Agent for explanation
4. Combined visual and textual response delivered
