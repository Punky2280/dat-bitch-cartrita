# Cartrita Telemetry User Manual

## üîç **What is OpenTelemetry in Cartrita?**

Cartrita has fully integrated the complete OpenTelemetry ecosystem - both the core JavaScript libraries and all contrib instrumentations - directly into the backend system. This means you have enterprise-grade observability without any external dependencies.

## ü§ñ **AI-Powered Telemetry Agent**

The **TelemetryAgent** understands natural language commands and can perform complex observability operations on your behalf.

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# System Status

## üõ†Ô∏è **Using the Telemetry Agent**

### In the Chat Interface

Simply ask Cartrita to perform telemetry operations:

```
You: "Can you check the telemetry status and create a trace for the current conversation?"

Cartrita: *Checking telemetry status...*
‚úÖ OpenTelemetry Integration: Fully Operational
‚úÖ Tracing: Active with 1,247 spans today  
‚úÖ Metrics: 23 active counters, 15 histograms
‚úÖ Agent Health: 98% performance score

*Creating conversation trace...*
üîç Trace "user-conversation-2025" created successfully
üìä Trace ID: abc123...
‚ö° Duration: 2.3ms with 4 child spans
```

### Via API Endpoints

```javascript
// Direct telemetry command
POST /api/telemetry/command
{
  "command": "Create a trace for payment processing",
  "context": {
    "userId": "user123",
    "sessionId": "session456"
  }
}

// Get telemetry status
GET /api/telemetry/status

// Access interactive manual
GET /api/telemetry/manual
```

## üìä **Understanding the Output**

### Trace Information

When you create or analyze traces, you'll see:
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Duration**: How long the operation took
- **Child Spans**: Sub-operations within the trace
- **Attributes**: Contextual information
- **Status**: Success/error indication

### Metrics Data

Metrics will show:
- **Counter Values**: Total counts
- **Histogram Distributions**: Value ranges and percentiles
- **Labels**: Dimensional data for filtering
- **Timestamps**: When data was recorded

### Performance Reports

Analysis includes:
- **Response Times**: Average, median, 95th percentile
- **Error Rates**: Percentage and trends
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, database connections
- **Recommendations**: AI-generated optimization suggestions

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**"Telemetry agent not responding"**
- Check: `"Check telemetry status"`
- Solution: System restart may be needed

**"Traces not appearing"**
- Verify: Tracing is enabled in status check
- Create: Manual test trace to verify functionality

**"Metrics showing zero values"**
- Ensure: Metrics are being actively recorded
- Check: Metric names match exactly

## üéâ **Best Practices**

### Effective Tracing

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: `"user-login-flow"` vs `"operation1"`
2. **Add Relevant Attributes**: Include user IDs, session info, business context
3. **Keep Traces Focused**: One trace per logical operation
4. **Regular Analysis**: Check traces weekly for performance insights

### Smart Metrics

1. **Counter Best Practices**: Use for events that only increase (requests, errors)
2. **Histogram Usage**: Ideal for measurements (response times, payload sizes)
3. **Label Management**: Include useful dimensions, avoid high cardinality
4. **Regular Review**: Analyze metrics trends for business insights

### Performance Optimization

1. **Monitor Key Flows**: Focus on critical user journeys
2. **Set Performance Baselines**: Know your normal operating parameters
3. **Proactive Monitoring**: Use telemetry to catch issues before users do
4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Let telemetry guide optimization efforts
