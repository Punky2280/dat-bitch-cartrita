## About This Project

**DBC:** **D**ata-driven **A**I **T**ool that **A**pplies **B**ehavioral **I**ntelligence **T**ools while **C**onnecting **H**umanity.

**Cartrita:** **C**ognitive **A**I **R**easoning **T**ool for **R**eal-time **I**nformation and **T**ask **A**utomation.

### Our Mission

We are not just building another AI assistant. We are building a partner.

Project: Dat Bitch Cartrita is a paradigm-shifting, cross-platform application that fuses a rebellious, uniquely self-aware AGI with an uncompromising ethical core. Our mission is to create an AI that is not only powerful and versatile but also fundamentally aligned with the best interests of its human user.

We believe that true artificial intelligence should empower, not replace. It should understand context, anticipate needs, and operate with a level of transparency and integrity that builds trust.

### The Technology

Cartrita is built on a robust, scalable, and secure technology stack designed for real-time interaction and complex task management.

* **Monorepo Architecture:** The entire project is managed within a single repository using NPM Workspaces, allowing for streamlined development across all services.
* **Agentic Core:** Cartrita's intelligence is powered by a multi-layered system orchestrated by a `CoreAgent`. This agent analyzes user intent and delegates tasks to a dynamic registry of specialized sub-agents, all leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-4o.
* **Real-Time Communication:** The frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Node.js/Express) communicate instantly via a secure WebSocket API, ensuring a fluid and responsive conversational experience.
* **Persistent & Secure Memory:** All user data, including conversation histories and API keys, is stored in a Dockerized PostgreSQL database. Sensitive information is encrypted at rest, ensuring user privacy is paramount.

### The Philosophy

We are committed to building AI that serves humanity first. This principle is not just a guideline; it is encoded into the foundation of our project through our unique licensing and the `ConstitutionalAI` sub-agent, which ensures all of Cartrita's actions adhere to a strict ethical framework. By using this application, you are joining a movement to build a better, more responsible future for artificial intelligence.
