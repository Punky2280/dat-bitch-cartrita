# AGI Commons License - Version 4.0

This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of the Dat Bitch Cartrita source code and its associated components. By accessing, using, or contributing to this project, you agree to the terms outlined below.

This is more than a standard open-source license; it's a social contract.

### Preamble

The purpose of this license is to ensure that any technology derived from or built upon this work serves the best interests of humanity. It is designed to encourage open collaboration while enforcing a strict, non-negotiable ethical framework. The intelligence, artificial or otherwise, developed from this project must remain a tool for empowerment, protection, and human flourishing.

### 1. Permissions

You are hereby granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to:

* **Use:** Run the software for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial.
* **Modify:** Create derivative works, adaptations, or enhancements.
* **Distribute:** Share the original software or your modifications with others.

### 2. Conditions

All permissions granted above are conditional upon adherence to the following:

* **Attribution:** You must retain all original copyright and license notices in the source code.
* **Share-Alike:** Any modifications or derivative works you distribute must be licensed under this same AGI Commons License v4. You may not apply any additional terms that would restrict the freedoms granted herein.

### 3. The Ethical AI Clause (Mandatory & Non-Negotiable)

This is the core of the license. Any software that uses, modifies, or is derived from any part of this project must adhere to the following principles:

* **Principle of "Do No Harm":** The software shall not be used to design, develop, or deploy systems that are intended to cause physical or psychological harm to human beings. This includes, but is not limited to, autonomous weapons, systems of oppression, or tools for targeted harassment.
* **Principle of User Sanctity:** The software must prioritize user privacy and data security above all else. It shall not engage in the unauthorized collection, storage, or sharing of personally identifiable information. All user data must be handled with explicit, informed consent.
* **Principle of Transparency:** The software's core decision-making processes should be, to the greatest extent possible, explainable and auditable. "Black box" systems that obscure their reasoning are antithetical to this principle.
* **Principle of Bias Mitigation:** You must make a continuous and good-faith effort to identify, measure, and mitigate harmful biases within the AI's models and behavior. The goal is to create technology that treats all individuals with fairness and equity.

### 4. Enforcement

Violation of the Ethical AI Clause (Section 3) will result in the immediate and automatic termination of all rights granted to you under this license.
